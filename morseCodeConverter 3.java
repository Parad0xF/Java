/*
Write a program that asks the user to enter a string, and then converts-
that string to Morse code and prints on the screen.
Use hyphens for dashes and periods for dots.
The Morse code table is given in a text file morse.txt.
When printing morse code, display eight codes on each line except the last line.
Codes should be separated from each other with one space.
There should be no extra spaces at the beginning and at the end of the output.
Uppercase and lowercase letters are translated the same way.
